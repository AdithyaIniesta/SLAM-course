1. This is a C++ framework for Extended Kalman Filter. 
2. Extended Kalman Filter is employed for tracking an object which is moving with constant velocity and turn rate. 
3. The filter has motion and observation model. 
4. The observation model uses both Laser and Radar measurements for correcting the prediction of the filter. 
5. We performed the comparison of filter performance with and without sensor fusion.
